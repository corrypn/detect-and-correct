How to setup the DNC script

1. Download the files dnc.py and urls.csv from this git project and copy them into a folder. Lets call "install directory"

2. Inside this folder open dnc.py using text edit and update the following values in the "#user setup‚Äù section
	1. dncdir : The directory where the downloaded reports should be saved for example "/Users/rsatrasala/Downloads/dnc". NOTE: This directory should be different from the install directory of step 1
	2. mmxusername : This is your metamarkets username "rsatrasala@twitter.com"

	4. reportRefreshTime :  30

3. open a terminal and change to the install directory by doing "cd <install directory>"
